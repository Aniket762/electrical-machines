## Abstract ##
<p>This web application is used to calculate the speed of two slip ring induction motors for two different types of cascading operation, where the shaft of the motors are coupled with each other.</p>
<p>It takes four inputs from the user:</p>
<ul>
<li>f1 = Frequency of supply given to machine 1 (Hz)</li>
<li>p1 = Number poles in machine 1</li>
<li>p2 = Number poles in machine 2</li>
</ul>
<p>We get speed (in radians) as output.</p>

#### Case A : Both machines are placed in same phase sequence and there is air gap flux.
<p>Speed = 120*f1/(p1+p2)</p>

#### Case B : Both machines are placed in opposite phase sequence and there is air gap flux.
<p>Speed = 120*f1/(p1-p2)</p>

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
#### Case C : Both machines are placed in opposite phase sequence and there is air gap flux.
<p>Speed = f1/(p1-p2)</p>
