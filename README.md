## Abstract ##
This web application is used to calculate the speed of two slip ring induction motors for different types of cascading operation, where the shaft 
of the motors are coupled with each other.
It takes four inputs from the user:
*f1 = Frequency of supply given to machine 1
*f2 = Frequency of supply given to machine 2
